So remove all kinds of unnec stuff:
* Sex.
* Keep interaction, add 'custom' part.

* Add ultruism and also co-operation

DeSerialization process for Grid:
* So there is an occupants pointer array for lookup, but also an occupants pointer list for quick iteration.
* Occupants list subsumes creats list
* Occupants list is serialized directly
* Creats have a special _Remove that ensures that they are added to the 'deadpool'
* The deadpool is not saved.
* Id is increment on creature reset. It counts births, basically. This gets rid of determinism problems, because the deadpool
has no identity.
* So there is a mixed solution here: everything is an occupant, but creats have the special deadpool mechanism to prevent churn.
